## Contains

Starter files provided by ALX for this project:

- [00-index.html](./00-index.html)
- [00-styles.css](./00-styles.css)

### Tasks

- **0. Fix the hero banner**: Because we did some changes with the `article.html` page in the previous project, our hero banner background is no more visible. Let’s fix it!

  - [01-index.html](./01-index.html)
  - [01-styles.css](./01-styles.css)

- **1. Make the container flexible**: Using the previous file as the base, in your `02-styles.css` file update the `.container` selector by changing `width` to `max-width`

  - [02-index.html](./02-index.html)
  - [02-styles.css](./02-styles.css)

- **2. Fix layout issues**: In a normal situation, you should start with “mobile first” in mind and write your CSS first for the mobile. But because we already have a desktop version, we will exceptionally add some media-queries for mobile and tablet.

  - [02-1-index.html](./02-1-index.html)
  - [02-1-styles.css](./02-1-styles.css)

- **3. Generate images with responsive breakpoints**

  - [03-index.html](./03-index.html)
  - [03-styles.css](./03-styles.css)

- **4. Create the mobile icon and hide the menu**: We want to have a clickable icon that shows and hide our navigation. We don’t want to use JavaScript but find a pure HTML / CSS way. We learned that input type checkbox have a checked - unchecked state. So we are going to use this for our menu.

  - [04-index.html](./04-index.html)
  - [04-styles.css](./04-styles.css)

- **5. Hamburger!**: Let’s now, use a little bit of CSS magic to create an “hamburger” icon just with CSS.

  - [05-index.html](./05-index.html)
  - [05-styles.css](./05-styles.css)

- **6. Add the behavior based on menu-btn state**

  - [06-index.html](./06-index.html)
  - [06-styles.css](./06-styles.css)

- **7. Make the font size responsive**: We have multiple ways to make the typography responsive. The basic way would be to create multiple media queries and set a different font-size. But because we are using REM that are based on 62.5% (defined in the html selector). Changing that value would change proportionally all font sizes.
